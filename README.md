# Real-time-ASL-Alphabet-Recognition
American Sign Language (ASL) is a natural language that serves as the predominant sign language of Deaf communities in the United States and Canada.
ASL has a set of 26 signs known as American Manual Alphabet, which is used to spell out words.
The goal is to build a system that can detect the alphabet signs in real-time from a webcam feed sent over a TCP network connection.
